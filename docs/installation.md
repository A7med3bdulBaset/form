Installing and using React Form is simple. Start by installing the `react-form` dependency:

$ yarn add react-form
# or
$ npm i react-form --save

Once it is installed, you can import and use `react-form`'s hooks and utilities:

```js
import { useForm, useField, splitFormProps } from 'react-form'
```
