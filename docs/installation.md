TanStack Form is compatible with various front-end frameworks, including React, Solid, Svelte and Vue. To use TanStack Form with your desired framework, install the corresponding adapter via NPM

```bash
$ npm i @tanstack/react-form
# or
$ pnpm add @tanstack/solid-form
# or
$ yarn add @tanstack/svelte-form
```

> Depending on your environment, you might need to add polyfills. If you want to support older browsers, you need to transpile the library from `node_modules` yourselves.
